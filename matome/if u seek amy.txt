Oh baby baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom? Is she smoking up outside?
Oh baby baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'mma buy her
Do you know just what she likes?

Oh

Oh, oh, tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home?

Ha ha he he ha ha ho

Love me, hate me, say you what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closing up the club
I've seen her once or twice before, she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standing in my way


Oh, oh, tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so, oh, I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gonna go
Can somebody take me home?

Ha ha he he ha ha ho

Love me, hate me, say you what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy
Love me, hate me, but can't you see what I see?

Oh, but can't you see what I see?

So tell me if you see her
(she was wearing or what she was like)
'Cause I've been waiting here forever
(she was going out of line)

Oh baby baby, if you seek Amy tonight (Oh)
Oh baby baby, we'll do whatever you like
Oh baby baby baby, oh baby baby baby
